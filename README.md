Baston mini-project
The Boston Housing dataset was used to create visualizations in Power BI that analyze housing conditions and price trends in Boston suburbs. With 506 records and 14 attributes, the dataset includes variables such as crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax, accessibility to highways, and more. These fields were used to build insightful visuals that explore relationships between housing features and the median home value (MEDV), helping to identify key factors influencing property prices.
